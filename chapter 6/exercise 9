#Write three functions that are the “inverses” of to_secs:

#hours_in returns the whole integer number of hours represented by a total number of seconds.
#minutes_in returns the whole integer number of left over minutes in a total number of seconds, once the hours have been taken out.
#seconds_in returns the left over seconds represented by a total number of seconds.
