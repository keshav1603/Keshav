  
#The four compass points can be abbreviated by single-letter strings as “N”, “E”, “S”, and “W”. Write a function turn_clockwise that takes one of these four compass points as its parameter, and returns the next compass point in the clockwise direction. Here are some tests that should pass:

def turn_clockwise(x):

    if x == "N":
        return "E"

    elif x == "E":
        return "S"

    elif x == "S":
        return "W"

    elif x == "W":
        return "N"



x = raw_input("What's the direction of the compass")


turn_clockwise(x)

print(x)
