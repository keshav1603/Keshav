#Write a function that helps answer questions like ‘“Today is Wednesday. I leave on holiday in 19 days time. What day will that be?”’ So the function must take a day name and a delta argument — the number of days to add — and should return the resulting day name:

def day_num(x):
    if x == "Monday":
        return 0
    elif x == "Tuesday":
        return 1
    elif x == "Wednesday":
        return  2
    elif x == "Thursday":
        return 3
    elif x == "Friday":
        return 4
    elif x == "Saturday":
        return 5
    elif x == "Sunday":
        return 6
    else:
        return "None"


def day_name(x):
    if x == 0:
        return "Monday"
    elif x == 1:
        return "Tuesday"
    elif x == 2:
        return "Wednesday"
    elif x == 3:
        return "Thursday"
    elif x == 4:
        return "Friday"
    elif x == 5:
        return "Saturday"
    elif x == 6:
        return "Sunday"
    else:
        return "None"


day = raw_input("What day is it?")
leave = int(input("In how many days are you leaving"))


present_day = day_num(day)

n = (present_day + leave) % 7

leave_day = day_name(n)

print(leave_day)
