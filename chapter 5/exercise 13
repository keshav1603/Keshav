#If you’re intrigued by why floating point arithmetic is sometimes inaccurate, on a piece of paper, divide 10 by 3 and write down the decimal result. You’ll find it does not terminate, so you’ll need an infinitely long sheet of paper.

import math

a = math.sqrt(2.0)
print(a, a * a)
print(a * a == 2.0)
